#Find some information
#To find out all services that have been run at startup:


# this will show all services that has been loaded at boot and are active now. If you want to get a list of all services no matter they are active or not:
systemctl list-units --type service

# Another thing you can do is to run:
systemctl list-units --type service --all

# then hit / and search for mongodb see what service/target depends on it and runs it.
systemctl list-dependencies --type service


#Also you can run :

locate mongodb.service

#Which produces something like:

/lib/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/mongodb.service

#then you will know that it's being started as a part of multi-user target, alternative to this is:

$ systemctl cat mongodb.service | grep -i wantedby

WantedBy=multi-user.target


# on ubunto the todobackend-client need to run grunt menually in order the webserver will have the necceceery dependencies



# To Completely Remove packages from ubunto 'apt'

#The command du "summarizes disk usage of each FILE, recursively for directories," e.g.,

du -hs /path/to/directory

sudo df -h /

-h is to get the numbers "human readable", e.g. get 140M instead of 143260 (size in KBytes)
-s is for summary (otherwise you'll get not only the size of the folder but also for everything in the folder separately)

chgrp usera /opt/test/abcd
chmod g=rwx /opt/test/abcd

id -Gn
which is equivalent to groups utility which has been obsoleted on Unix (as per Unix manual).

On macOS and Unix, the command id -p is suggested for normal interactive.

Explanation of the parameters:

-G, --groups - print all group IDs

-n, --name - print a name instead of a number, for -ugG

-p - Make the output human-readable.
